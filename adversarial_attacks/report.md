# Adversarial Attacks in AI-based Cybersecurity

## 1. What is an Adversarial Attack?

Adversarial attacks are deliberate manipulations of AI/ML systems using crafted inputs that cause incorrect predictions. These attacks exploit model vulnerabilities and can occur in NLP, computer vision, and intrusion detection systems.

**Examples:**
- NLP: Altered spam messages (e.g., "fr33 m0ney")
- Computer Vision: Modified images to fool classifiers
- IDS: Attack patterns mimicking benign traffic

## 2. Types of Adversarial Attacks
- **Evasion Attacks:** Modify inputs at inference to evade detection (e.g., malware obfuscation)
- **Data Poisoning:** Inject malicious samples into training data
- **Model Inversion/Extraction:** Infer sensitive data or reconstruct models via queries
- **Obfuscation Techniques:** Hide intent with code/data obfuscation

**Real-world Examples:** DeepLocker malware, Tesla autopilot attacks, spam poisoning

## 3. Impact on Security, Reliability, Trust
- **Security:** Bypass detection, enable breaches
- **Reliability:** Cause critical errors
- **Trust:** Erode confidence in AI systems

## 4. Defense Strategies
- **Detection:** Input sanitization, anomaly detection
- **Robust Training:** Adversarial training, input randomization, defensive distillation
- **Best Practices:** Model hardening, ensembles, continuous monitoring, access controls

## 5. Case Studies
- **Malware Detection:** Adversarial training improves robustness
- **Vision Systems:** Input randomization reduces attack success
- **API Model Extraction:** Rate limiting and monitoring deter attackers

## 6. Recommendations
- Audit models, use layered defenses, monitor, educate teams, and stay updated.
