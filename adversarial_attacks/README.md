This project explores adversarial attacks within modern AI/ML systems, their impact on cybersecurity, and robust defense strategies. It includes a structured report, hands-on simulation code, and automated tests.

## Contents
- `report.md`: Detailed synthesis of attack types, impacts, and defenses
- `simulation/`: Python code demonstrating adversarial attacks and defenses
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `tests/`: Automated tests for attacks and defenses
- `.github/workflows/`: CI configuration for GitHub Actions

## Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Run simulations**: `python simulation/attack_demo.py` (or other scripts in `simulation/`)
3. **Explore interactively**: `jupyter lab simulation/interactive_exploration.ipynb`
4. **Run tests**: `pytest tests/`

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- GitHub Actions workflow runs all tests on push and pull requests to `main`.
- See `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` for configuration.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter pip or environment errors, try using a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/Scripts/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- If tests fail due to type issues, ensure all return values are native Python types (`bool`, `float`, etc.).
- For advanced NLP attacks, install `textattack` (optional, may require extra setup).

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome! Please add or update tests for any new features or fixes.
