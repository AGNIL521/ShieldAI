This project explores adversarial attacks within modern AI/ML systems, their impact on cybersecurity, and robust defense strategies. It includes a structured report, hands-on simulation code, and automated tests.

## Contents
- `report.md`: Detailed synthesis of attack types, impacts, and defenses
- `simulation/`: Python code demonstrating adversarial attacks and defenses
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `tests/`: Automated tests for attacks and defenses
- `.github/workflows/`: CI configuration for GitHub Actions

## Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Run simulations**: `python simulation/attack_demo.py` (or other scripts in `simulation/`)
3. **Explore interactively**: `jupyter lab simulation/interactive_exploration.ipynb`
4. **Run the web dashboard**: `python dashboard.py` and open [http://127.0.0.1:8050](http://127.0.0.1:8050)
5. **Run tests**: `pytest tests/`

### File Preview & Validation
- After uploading a file, a preview of the first 5 rows or a summary will be shown before running attacks in the relevant dashboard tab.
- If the file format is not supported or parsing fails, a clear error message will be displayed in the preview area.
- ZIP file support is preview-only (lists files in archive; image batch attacks not yet supported). This applies to all upload boxes that mention ZIP.

## Dashboard Visualization
- The dashboard provides a web interface to run and visualize attacks and defenses.
- In the Image Attack tab, you can view the original, adversarial, and difference images using interactive buttons.
- Other tabs let you run NLP, IDS, and defense demos and see results instantly.

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- GitHub Actions workflow runs all tests on push and pull requests to `main`.
- See `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` for configuration.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter pip or environment errors, try using a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/Scripts/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- If tests fail due to type issues, ensure all return values are native Python types (`bool`, `float`, etc.).
- For advanced NLP attacks, install `textattack` (optional, may require extra setup).

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome! Please add or update tests for any new features or fixes.
