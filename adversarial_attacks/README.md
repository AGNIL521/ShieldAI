# Adversarial Attacks in AI-based Cybersecurity

This project explores adversarial attacks within modern AI/ML systems, their impact on cybersecurity, and robust defense strategies. It includes a structured report and hands-on simulation code.

## Contents
- `report.md`: Detailed synthesis of attack types, impacts, and defenses
- `simulation/`: Python code demonstrating adversarial attacks and defenses
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Explore the report in `report.md`
3. Run the simulation: `python simulation/attack_demo.py`
